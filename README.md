# QuIPS
**Quantum Information Processing System**

> Bertrand Russel said *"War does not determine who is right, only who is left"*.

We can interpret this as, *Quantum Mechanics does not determine which outcome is right, only which operators are to the left*.

That motto will be the starting point of this project; modeling a quantum computer as a sequence of gate operations on an initital tensor product state of n Qubits.  

Julia is being used because it is better then whatever language you want to compare it to. 

## Usage

A quantum compuatation begins with specifying a list of successive gates and measurements.  We shall call this quantum information process a *quip*. Additionally, the number of qubits must be specified.
